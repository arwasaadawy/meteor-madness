Meteor Madness, is a Python-based interactive tool designed to simulate and visualize asteroid impact scenarios. It combines NASA open datasets (such as CNEOS and JPL Small-Body Database) with scientific impact models to create an accessible way of exploring planetary defense challenges.

Here’s what it does:
	•	Lets users input asteroid parameters (size, velocity, impact angle).
	•	Runs simulations to calculate outcomes like crater size, thermal effects, and shockwave impact.
	•	Provides visualizations and summaries of the potential consequences.
	•	Includes a defense simulator to test strategies such as kinetic impactors, nuclear deflection, and gravity tractors.

Benefits & Intended Impact:
	•	Educational: Makes complex astrophysics concepts easy to understand for students and the public.
	•	Decision support: Offers a simplified environment for exploring “what if” scenarios relevant to planetary defense.
	•	Awareness: Highlights the importance of asteroid monitoring and Earth protection strategies.

Tools & Resources:
	•	Python (core language for simulation and visualization)
	•	NASA open data (CNEOS, JPL Small-Body Database)
	•	Impact models (inspired by USGS data)

Our creativity lies in transforming raw scientific data into a user-friendly and interactive format. Instead of static reports, the project delivers a hands-on experience where users can actively explore both risks and possible solutions
